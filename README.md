# README

### General Instructions
      Read this doc carefully and go over the given code. 
      Use this as a checklist to complete the basic functioning code.
      There are additional comments included in the code files, pay attention to those as well.
      Use Google, MDN and StackOverflow for ideas and looking up suntax and inbuilt functions.
      TIP: Console.log data to figure out what's happening and where the program is breaking.

### HTML

### CSS

### JavaScript
  #### Create a dictionary
        1. Decide what data structure (Array/ Object) would make sense for storing the words
        2. Declare the var and add some data

  #### Create a function to generate a random word 
        Using JS inbuilt function(s) pick a random word from the dictionary and return it

### JQuery
  #### Handle button clicks to generate the random word
        Make sure a jQuery min file has been included in the index.html
        In the index.html file:
        1. Add an ID to your generator button
        2. Create an event handler 
            There are multiple ways to listen to an event and trigger a response
            Look up various methods on MDN and try one or more.
        3. Test your button event by console logging the output

  #### Display the output to the html
        Make sure the generator-script is included in the index.html
        1. Make an html div for displaying your output
        2. Add a class to your new div
        3. In your event handler, use the newly created div to diplay the output of the random function


  ### Extra Credit
    Add other input fields to your html such as an text field, dropdown, etc
    Think of features to use with your new input fields
    Randomize something other than words, build something more complex like sentences from words
    Play around with background colors and images
